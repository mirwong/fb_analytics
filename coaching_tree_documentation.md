# Coaching Tree

The Coaching Tree is an ongoing effort to put together a comprehensive map of football coaches and their influences, from the very first Rutgers-Princeton game in 1869 to the present day, encompassing both college and the NFL.

As time goes on, it's becoming clear that, for completeness' sake, the Coaching Tree will have to include other positions in football, such as players and executives. However, this subset of the map is currently extremely incomplete and should not be relied upon for any scheme-related coloring.

## List of features yet to be added
### Football-related
- More accurate age scaling. Currently, the color of the dots is scaled based on when the coach started their coaching career. This can be misleading if they played in the league and then jumped to coaching. Additionally, coaches who did not achieve prominence till later in their coaching careers can also have misleading colors.
- Overall measure of influence. How do we tell how much influence any given coach actually had over their assistants? Does this require film study? Hopefully not, especially given it's going to be hard to find game film AND someone who understands schemes from 1920. The following points are by no means an exhaustive list of ways to go about this. This isn't Python.
   - Representing schemes. This is probably the end goal of this map, and is pretty ambitious --- probably requiring film study, or at least a better understanding than the one I have. A starting point might be Madden playbooks, but that's just my first idea. This also disregards a lot of coevolution of concepts --- ex. playing the same defense as a Halas team, but with dime packages because of the vast development of passing in general and spread offenses in particular.
   - Connection types. In an effort to make the scaled colors more obvious, differentiating the types of connections between coaches (family members, player-coach, assistant) has been disregarded and all look the same.
   - Connection direction. Obviously, representing the actual flow of ideas is important. This can possibly be automated through more data for each point, though this is questionable, since it doesn't always go head coach --> assistant. For example, is Wade Phillips actually learning defense from Sean McVay or is it really the other way around? What if it goes both ways?
- Adding executives and players. See 2nd paragraph. This is particularly important before ~1920 in college football and ~1960 in the NFL or maybe later, as many people served multiple positions in early football. In fact, in thinking about this, they still do; think Bill Belichick. And does Tom Brady have influence on young coaches? Or players-turned-coaches? Does he need to be on here, like the George Halases of old? (Note that Al Davis is on here - I think he's the only pure exec on the tree right now but was necessary to show the Raiders' continuity over time, between Gruden and others.)
- More fields. For more real data analysis, many more football-related biographical fields are needed. **please expand**
- Filling out fields. As evidenced by the plethora of gray dots, even the simple date started/date retired fields just need to be looked up on Wikipedia or similar.
- Staying up to date (not a field, but same idea). The NFL coaching carousel goes very quickly. Especially if the "current position" field is helpful, it should be updated on a regular basis.

### Function-related
- I thought of a lot of questions for this section along the lines of "does Kumu work for this" but have forgotten them in the time it took to think of an overall header.

## Sources
### General Sources
The following sources have been invaluable. Maybe annotated citations are just on my mind, but I think I should at least write down the links for future reference.
- Wikipedia, especially the "Coaching Tree" section of any given coach's page. Additionally, coaches not specifically linked have sometimes been tracked through their career listings, by seeing the coaching staff of a team during a given year.

- [Road Trip Sports' Coaching Tree](http://roadtripsports.com/coaches/the-college-football-coaching-tree/). The only tree that appears to be solely dedicated to college football, and especially early CFB icons such as Yost, Stagg, Heisman, etc. **done, as far as I can tell**
- [NFL Coach Family Tree Graphic](http://graphics.wsj.com/nfl-coaches/). The original inspiration for this, circa 2016. The [actual article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/sports/nfl-coaching-trees-connecting-every-active-coach/) has subsets. **not done**
- [Power Ranking the Greatest Coaching Trees in NFL History](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1058677-power-ranking-the-greatest-coaching-trees-in-nfl-history#slide0). Not entirely accurate, but a starting point for early NFL history. **done**
-[Miami of Ohio Cradle of Coaches](https://spec.lib.miamioh.edu/cradleofcoaches/). Looks like an absolute treasure trove. **not done**

### Specific Sources
Documentation/references for specific coaches. It seems easier to find here rather than putting the sources into specific parts of the map.
- [Bill Belichick/John Harbaugh](https://www.espn.com/blog/new-england-patriots/post/_/id/4818534/belichick-harbaugh-fierce-competitors-add-fire-to-afcs-best-rivalry)
- Michigan lore, general B1G knowledge, specific Michigan-OSU knowledge. Note that I don't know which Michigan books I pulled from, since I haven't done a comprehensive read of the Michigan section since circa 2012.

- John Behee's *Fielding Yost's Legacy*, definitely.
